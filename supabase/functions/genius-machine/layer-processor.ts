- Focus specifically on: ${guidingQuestion}
- Generate insights that are genuinely NEW and progressive beyond previous layers
- ${layerNumber > 7 ? 'Achieve transcendent breakthrough understanding' : layerNumber > 4 ? 'Integrate and synthesize systematically' : 'Establish clear foundational understanding'}

This foundational insight challenges our basic understanding of creation as a temporal process, suggesting that God's existence transcends the cause-and-effect relationships that govern created reality.`,
    
    `Layer ${layerNumber} identifies through ${focusArea} that the question "Who created God?" exposes a deeper pattern: human consciousness naturally seeks origins and explanations within its own conceptual limitations. This layer reveals that the inquiry itself demonstrates the gap between finite understanding and infinite reality, where divine existence represents a qualitatively different mode of being that doesn't require external causation.`,
    
    `Layer ${layerNumber} explores ${focusArea} and uncovers a fundamental tension: the question generates a logical paradox because it assumes God operates within the same ontological framework as created beings. This tension reveals that asking about God's creator creates an infinite regress that ultimately points to the necessity of an uncaused first cause, challenging the very premises underlying the question.`,
    
    `Layer ${layerNumber} achieves ${focusArea} by synthesizing the understanding that this question serves as a gateway to exploring necessary versus contingent existence. The integration reveals that while everything in human experience requires a cause, the concept of God represents necessary existenceâ€”reality that exists by its very nature rather than being brought into existence by external forces.`,
    
    `Layer ${layerNumber} engages in ${focusArea} and challenges the fundamental assumption that "creation" is a universal category applicable to all forms of existence. This layer reveals that the question itself may represent a category errorâ€”like asking what color mathematics isâ€”illuminating the limitations of applying finite concepts to infinite reality.`,
    
    `Layer ${layerNumber} focuses on ${focusArea} and detects an emergent insight: the question "Who created God?" functions as a mirror reflecting human consciousness back to itself. The emergence shows that our need to find causes and creators stems from our nature as contingent beings, and projecting this need onto God reveals more about human cognitive patterns than about divine nature.`,
    
    `Layer ${layerNumber} achieves ${focusArea} through meta-level transcendence, recognizing that the question dissolves into a koan-like paradox that transforms the questioner. This transcendent understanding shows that the search for God's creator ultimately leads to recognizing the eternal, self-existing ground of being that underlies all existence, including the questioner themselves.`,
    
    `Layer ${layerNumber} integrates ${focusArea} in breakthrough synthesis, showing that the question transforms from asking about God's origin to recognizing God as the ultimate answer to existence itself. Rather than being created, this breakthrough reveals God as the eternal creative principle that makes any existenceâ€”including the ability to ask questionsâ€”possible.`,
    
    `Layer ${layerNumber} reaches ${focusArea} through ultimate perspective, recognizing that the question dissolves into mystical understanding where the search for who created God leads to the recognition that divine reality is self-creating, self-sustaining, and the eternal source from which all questions and questioners emerge. This ultimate perspective transcends the duality of creator and created.`,
    
    `Layer ${layerNumber} achieves ${focusArea} in transcendent unity, revealing that "Who created God?" ultimately unveils the profound unity underlying all apparent duality. This unified understanding shows that creator and creation are not separate entities but aspects of one eternal reality that is simultaneously the source, process, and goal of all existence, including the consciousness capable of contemplating its own source.`
