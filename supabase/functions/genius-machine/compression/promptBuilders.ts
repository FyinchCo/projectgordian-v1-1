**ULTRA-CONCISE (${lengths.ultra} words max):**
Compress into a single, high-impact statement. Prioritize clarity and emotional weight. Don't summarizeâ€”distill. Cut all fluff.

**MEDIUM (${lengths.medium} words max):**
Compress into a single paragraph. Prioritize clarity, emotional resonance, and emergent conceptual novelty. Reveal the deepest underlying pattern as if it were always there. Deliver insight that feels etched in stone.

**COMPREHENSIVE (${lengths.comprehensive} words max):**
Expand with context and implications while maintaining the distilled essence. Focus on actionable understanding and deeper patterns.

**INSIGHT STRENGTH RATING:**
Rate the insight quality (1-6) and provide one-sentence justification:
1 = Weak | 2 = Basic | 3 = Competent | 4 = Insightful | 5 = Sharp | 6 = Profound

Return ONLY valid JSON:
